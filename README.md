d.) Description for "About" page (our mission):\
Our goal is to pass on the knowledge we have gained over the last ten years in the dance field and as dance teachers to the next generation and thus contribute to a strong dance culture in Vienna. We not only teach movements, but also focus on togetherness. In addition to training dance knowledge, coordination, tact, motor skills and fitness, we focus on social values such as a sense of community and building self-confidence. We want to offer our members a place where they feel comfortable, grow dance-wise, make friends and simply have fun.

e.) The product is a website providing information about different dance courses and the available timeslots for them. The website allows to directly contact the dance teachers for each course. The user can see the timeslots for courses, information about membership and pricing.

g.) Other relevant info:\
The members should be able to listen to the currently used soundtracks in the courses to be able to practise at home. They should also be able to watch dance introduction videos on the website.
We are aware that we are not supposed to create interacting websites - thats why for implementing we thought to tell our client to create dummy pages (e.g. Login for Dance Teachers).

# Website Requirements

# Visual Style
Salsa Swings Dance Studio provides lots of experience in the different dance-types while providing a modern and young environment for its students. This should also be represented in the visual style of the website.

Our color palette:
- Base Color: #FF9700
- Accent Color: #0C5AA6
- Light Gray: #B0B0B0
- Dark Gray: #2C2C2C

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/zGkkGHV/Color-Palette-Salsa-Swings-Dance-Studio.png" width="250" />

The colors are really flashy to represent the young and modern environment. The Website should feature the contrast between the base color and the accent color to create an interesting visual. Also the provided logo svg provides a nice synergy when put on a background with the base color. 
Feelwise the website should provide a modern visual by creating sharp edges without any rounded edges and a layered visual by adding drop-shadows on foreground-elements. 
The navigation + header should be implemented in a way, that there's a header with the logo on top and below that there should be a light-gray navigation bar. When scrolling down, the header should disappear on top while the navigation bar stays on top (sticky-positioning). 
To archieve an affordance-character, links in the navigation or buttons should react to a mouse-hover to signal functionality to the user.
