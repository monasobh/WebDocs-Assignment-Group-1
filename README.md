d.) Description for "About" page (our mission):\
Our goal is to pass on the knowledge we have gained over the last ten years in the dance field and as dance teachers to the next generation and thus contribute to a strong dance culture in Vienna. We not only teach movements, but also focus on togetherness. In addition to training dance knowledge, coordination, tact, motor skills and fitness, we focus on social values such as a sense of community and building self-confidence. We want to offer our members a place where they feel comfortable, grow dance-wise, make friends and simply have fun.

e.) The product is a website providing information about different dance courses and the available timeslots for them. The website allows to directly contact the dance teachers for each course. The user can see the timeslots for courses, information about membership and pricing.

g.) Other relevant info:\
The members should be able to listen to the currently used soundtracks in the courses to be able to practise at home. They should also be able to watch dance introduction videos on the website.
We are aware that we are not supposed to create interacting websites - thats why for implementing we thought to tell our client to create dummy pages (e.g. Login for Dance Teachers).
