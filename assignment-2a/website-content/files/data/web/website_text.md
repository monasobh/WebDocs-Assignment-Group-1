The beginner salsa dance enthusiast's journey begins with this five-week session. No prior dance training is required or anticipated. Both male and female students will learn the basic concepts of partnering, dance floor manners, timing, fundamental footwork, full and half turns, "cross body lead," and practical salsa dancing patterns in these dance sessions.


##Irish Dance

This class is designed exclusively for our youngest dancers. It is best suited to keep the interest of our little dancers because it is only a half-hour long and is quite entertaining. Playing entertaining Irish dance games with friends helps us learn our reel, fundamental dancing skills, and how to count to the music. Who could not love this? Tiny tots will enjoy making new friends while learning coordination, balance, collaboration, and musicality in this class.


##Hip Hop

Hip hop has a LARGE amount of performance. In addition to seeing dancers learn and perform the choreography, we also want to watch them perform for and amuse their audience on stage and in class. At all times in class, unless otherwise instructed, we anticipate seeing dancers giving it their all.


##Charleston

Our vivacious and energizing Charleston Dance Classes will expose you to the hot jazz sounds of the Charleston and have you moving with speed, vitality, and expression. They are suitable for total beginners as well as the more experienced Swing or Jive Dancer. For you to suit around your schedule, we provide both one-time workshops and four-week short courses.

##Swing

In addition to being well-liked, swing dancing is also one of the easiest and most adaptable dances to master. You will learn both West Coast Swing, a modern dance for a variety of music from Michael Jackson to hip hop, pop, and R&B, and East Coast Swing (also known as Jitterbug), danced to Big Band, Swing, and Rock n' Roll.



##Salsa 

Salsa is a sensual, upbeat, and enjoyable partner dance. It is a fairly social dance, unlike several partner dances where you must have a regular partner. The practice of salseros dancing with strangers is actually rather frequent. That's a fun aspect of salsa dancing. Salsa is known for being friendly and has gained enormous popularity all around the world. Salsa clubs are now widely available anywhere you travel in the entire planet.



##Irish Dance
Traditional Gaelic or Celtic dance styles called Irish dance or Irish dancing have their roots in Ireland. It can be performed solo or in ensembles of up to twenty skilled dancers or more. Irish dance is a style of social dancing in Ireland, while it also occasionally appears in official events and competitions.

It is generally performed with precise footwork and is well renowned for the dancers' stiff upper bodies. Irish dancers do not use their arms or hands to emphasize their footwork, in contrast to other dancing styles.



##Hip Hop

When performed to hip hop music, hip hop dance is a style of movement distinguished by bounces and rockers. It was born in Black neighborhoods in 1970s New York and has strong historical and social roots in African American culture. Contrary to popular belief, hip hop dancing is just one aspect of the larger Hip Hop culture, which also include deejaying, graffiti, emceeing, and breaking.

Growing up in the Bronx in the 1970s was difficult and dangerous. Drugs, crime, poverty, gang violence, and general strife surrounded the young people.

However, they were disregarded by mainstream institutions, particularly the minority youngsters of African American and Latino descent.

They created their own art forms out of a desperate need to escape the challenges they faced every day.


##Charleston

Charleston, a social jazz dance that saw many revivals in the 1920s, was very popular. It was done solo, with a partner, or as part of a group, and was distinguished by its toes-in, heels-out twisting steps. It was initially a black folk dance popular throughout the American South, notably in Charleston, South Carolina, and was mentioned as early as 1903. Its movements can be analyzed to see how closely it resembles specific dances from Trinidad, Nigeria, and Ghana. Early versions of the dance were largely abandoned, and it was performed to intricate beats produced by handclaps and foot stamping.




##Swing

Swing dancing is a fun kind of social dancing where partners are frequently lifted, spun, and flipped by the dancer. Swing dancing is a popularity among social dancers of all ages since it is regarded as both trendy and fashionable.

Finding swing dancers is simple—just search for the couple who is having the most fun and is grinning widely. There is a lot of swinging, flipping, and flinging of dancers during swing dance. It is a well-liked dance for a packed dance floor because it is a non-progressive dancing style and is primarily done in one location. Swing is a swift, brisk dance. Instead of holding hands around the waist or on the shoulders like ballroom dancers do, couples hold hands.
